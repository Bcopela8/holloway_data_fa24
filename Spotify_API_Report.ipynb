    "# API Report\n",
    "## Ash S. Copeland (Holloway)\n",
    "### 10/11/2024\n",
    "My Hypothesis that is testable with the Spotify API is Tracks artists release in summer gain more traction and are more likely to become a “greatest hit” song than in winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical applications are that you would be able to better the chances of a song becoming a \"greatest hit\". The Statistical Applications are the ability to graph and track songs from their release date in order to ensure their success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spotify Endpoints:** I used the Get Album Tracks and Get Several Tracks Endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why endpoints are suitable to test hypthesis:** These Endpoints allowed me to take the greatest Hits albumn from Queen, extract the songs and their Track ID's, and use those ID's to get the release dates of the songs to compare against one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ways data is reliable and unreliable?**\n",
    "In this report, I used Queen due to the legth of their active music career for a good pull of data. The long time between greatest hit releases and wide array of data makes this test reliable, yet the data is only for one artist and genre, which makes it questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations or caveats to response that limit hypothesis?**\n",
    "There certainly are limitations. Considering this pull was done from a single artist for the sake of simplificty for this project, the data's results are rather limited. In an actual test, it would be better to pull from multiple years of greatest hits accross multiple genres and analyze the trends between them."

    "After viewing the data above, with the exception of item 9 that only had a listed release year, we can see a clear pattern! Only 3 of the 16 songs were released in the summer time! And 11 were released during the winter months. This disproves my hypothesis! It appears Queen recieved more greatest hits in the winter than the summer! As stated above, this analysis is limited due to it only being a pull from one artist. I believe the alternate approach stated in the begin would still provide a better outcome. Next steps would be to work on a deeper analysis of this data from a greater and wider pull in order to confirm the new hypothesis of winter months pringing more greatest hits! and then we begin the process again!"
